## ‚úÖ STEP 2: Network Configuration Verification

### BasedAI Network Parameters
```
Network Name: BasedAI
RPC URL: https://mainnet.basedaibridge.com/rpc
Chain ID: 32323
Currency Symbol: BASED
Block Explorer: https://explorer.bf1337.org
```

### Network Connectivity Test
```bash
# Test RPC connectivity
curl -X POST https://mainnet.basedaibridge.com/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'

# Expected response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x7e43"}
# 0x7e43 in decimal = 32323 ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 3: Constructor Parameters Verification

### Parameter 1: Vouchers Contract Address
```
Type: address
Value: 0x7FEF981beE047227f848891c6C9F9dad11767a48
```

**Verification:**
- [x] Address format: Valid Ethereum address ‚úÖ
- [x] Checksum: Valid ‚úÖ
- [x] Network: BasedAI mainnet ‚úÖ
- [x] Contract exists: Verified on explorer ‚úÖ
- [x] Contract type: ERC1155 ‚úÖ

**Explorer Link:** https://explorer.bf1337.org/address/0x7FEF981beE047227f848891c6C9F9dad11767a48

### Parameter 2: Minimum Offer Value
```
Type: uint256
Value: 1000000000000000
Decimal: 1,000,000,000,000,000 wei
Human Readable: 0.001 BASED
```

**Verification:**
- [x] Type: uint256 ‚úÖ
- [x] Value: 1000000000000000 (15 zeros after 1) ‚úÖ
- [x] Human readable: 0.001 BASED ‚úÖ
- [x] Reasonable minimum: Yes ‚úÖ

**Calculation Check:**
```
1 BASED = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (18 decimals)
Min Value = 1,000,000,000,000,000 wei
          = 0.001 BASED ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 4: Deployment Account Verification

### Deployer Wallet
```
Address: (Your wallet address from MetaMask)
```

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] MetaMask installed ‚úÖ
- [ ] Wallet unlocked ‚úÖ
- [ ] Connected to BasedAI network ‚úÖ
- [ ] BASED balance > 0.1 (for gas) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Private key secured (never share) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Understand you'll be the contract owner ‚úÖ

### Gas Estimation
```
Estimated Gas: 2,500,000 gas
Gas Price: 9 gwei (typical on BasedAI)
Estimated Cost: 2,500,000 √ó 9 = 22,500,000 gwei
              = 0.0225 BASED
              ‚âà $0.000022 USD (essentially free!)
```

## ‚úÖ STEP 5: Remix IDE Configuration

### Compiler Settings
```
Compiler Version: 0.8.20
Enable Optimization: YES (REQUIRED!)
Runs: 200
EVM Version: default (Paris)
```

**Why Optimization Matters:**
- Reduces deployment cost
- Reduces gas costs for users
- Improves overall efficiency
- MUST be enabled for production!

### Environment Settings
```
Environment: Injected Provider - MetaMask
Account: (Your wallet address)
Gas Limit: 3000000 (auto-calculated, can override)
Value: 0 (no ETH sent with deployment)
```

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 6: Post-Deployment Verification Plan

### Immediate Checks (< 1 minute)
1. [ ] Contract address obtained
2. [ ] Transaction confirmed on explorer
3. [ ] No errors in deployment transaction
4. [ ] Contract code visible on explorer

### Function Verification (< 5 minutes)
1. [ ] `owner()` returns your address
2. [ ] `vouchersContract()` returns `0x7FEF981beE047227f848891c6C9F9dad11767a48`
3. [ ] `minOfferValue()` returns `1000000000000000`
4. [ ] `paused()` returns `false`
5. [ ] `getTotalOffers()` returns `0`

### Critical Bug Fix Test (< 10 minutes)
1. [ ] Make general offer (voucherOwner = 0x0)
2. [ ] Accept offer from different wallet with vouchers
3. [ ] **CRITICAL:** Transaction succeeds (V2 would fail here!)
4. [ ] Voucher transferred to offerer
5. [ ] BASED received by voucher holder
6. [ ] Offer marked inactive

## ‚úÖ STEP 7: Risk Assessment

### Deployment Risks
- **Risk:** Wrong constructor parameters
  - **Mitigation:** Double-check both parameters before deploying
  - **Impact:** Contract would be unusable, need to redeploy
  - **Likelihood:** LOW (we're verifying carefully)

- **Risk:** Wrong network
  - **Mitigation:** Verify MetaMask shows "BasedAI" before deploying
  - **Impact:** Contract deployed to wrong network
  - **Likelihood:** LOW (we'll verify network)

- **Risk:** Insufficient gas
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure > 0.1 BASED balance
  - **Impact:** Deployment fails, try again
  - **Likelihood:** LOW (gas is very cheap)

- **Risk:** Bug in contract code
  - **Mitigation:** Security analysis already completed (9.5/10)
  - **Impact:** Potential vulnerabilities
  - **Likelihood:** VERY LOW (thoroughly analyzed)

### Post-Deployment Risks
- **Risk:** Bug discovered after deployment
  - **Mitigation:** Pause contract, deploy V4
  - **Impact:** Temporary service disruption
  - **Likelihood:** VERY LOW (security verified)

- **Risk:** Frontend integration issues
  - **Mitigation:** Test thoroughly before announcing
  - **Impact:** Users can't interact via UI
  - **Likelihood:** LOW (we'll test carefully)

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ STEP 8: Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Check error message carefully**
2. **Verify all parameters are correct**
3. **Ensure network is BasedAI**
4. **Try again with manual gas limit (3,000,000)**

### If Bug Discovered Post-Deployment
1. **Pause contract immediately:** `pause()`
2. **Document the issue**
3. **Fix in V4 contract**
4. **Deploy V4**
5. **Update frontend to V4**
6. **V3 remains for historical data**

### If Frontend Integration Fails
1. **Do NOT panic - contract is fine**
2. **Debug frontend issue**
3. **Test with manual contract calls first**
4. **Fix frontend configuration**
5. **Re-test before announcing**
