# Testing Guide - MUST Complete Before Deployment

**CRITICAL: Do NOT deploy without running these tests!**

---

## Current Status

**Node.js Version Issue:**
```
Current: v23.11.0 ‚ùå
Required: v22.x LTS (even number) ‚úÖ
Issue: Hardhat not compatible with Node 23
```

**Testing Status:**
- ‚ùå Tests have NOT been run yet
- ‚ùå Bug fix NOT verified in tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contract MUST NOT be deployed until tested

---

## PHASE 1: Install Node Version Manager

### Option A: Install nvm (Recommended)

**Step 1: Install nvm**

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

**Step 2: Activate nvm**

Close and reopen Terminal, OR run:
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

**Step 3: Verify nvm installed**
```bash
nvm --version
# Should show: 0.39.0 or similar
```

**Step 4: Install Node 22 LTS**
```bash
nvm install 22
```

**Step 5: Switch to Node 22**
```bash
nvm use 22
```

**Step 6: Verify Node version**
```bash
node --version
# Should show: v22.x.x ‚úÖ
```

---

## PHASE 2: Prepare Hardhat Test Environment

**Navigate to contracts directory:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Kektheory/kektheory-frontend/contracts/offers-v3
```

**Install dependencies (if not already done):**
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- hardhat
- @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
- @openzeppelin/contracts
- ethers
- chai

**Expected:** Installation completes without errors

---

## PHASE 3: Compile Contracts

**Compile the contracts:**
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Compiled 5 Solidity files successfully
‚úì KektvVouchersOffersV3
‚úì MockERC1155Vouchers
‚úì OpenZeppelin contracts
```

**If compilation fails:**
- Verify Node version is 22.x
- Check contract code is complete
- Ensure OpenZeppelin is installed
- Try: `npm install` again

---

## PHASE 4: Run Test Suite

**Run all tests:**
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
KektvVouchersOffersV3
  üî• CRITICAL: General Offer Bug Fix
    ‚úì Should accept general offer with vouchers (V3 BUG FIX!)
    ‚úì Should fail to accept general offer without vouchers
    ‚úì Should allow multiple users to race for general offer

  Targeted Offers (Backward Compatibility)
    ‚úì Should accept targeted offer (V2 behavior preserved)
    ‚úì Should reject targeted offer from wrong user

  Offer Lifecycle
    ‚úì Should create offer with correct parameters
    ‚úì Should cancel offer and refund

  Security
    ‚úì Should enforce minimum offer value
    ‚úì Should protect against reentrancy

  View Functions
    ‚úì Should track user offers
    ‚úì Should track received offers

  11 passing (2s)
```

**Critical Tests to Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ "Should accept general offer with vouchers (V3 BUG FIX!)"
   - **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST!**
   - Verifies general offers can be accepted
   - V2 would fail this test
   - V3 must pass this test

2. ‚úÖ "Should fail to accept general offer without vouchers"
   - Verifies proper validation

3. ‚úÖ "Should allow multiple users to race for general offer"
   - Verifies race condition handling

---

## PHASE 5: Analyze Test Results

### If ALL Tests Pass ‚úÖ

**Verification:**
```
‚úì 11 passing tests
‚úì 0 failing tests
‚úì Critical bug fix test passed
‚úì Security tests passed
‚úì Backward compatibility verified
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

**Next Step:** Proceed to deployment following `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

---

### If ANY Test Fails ‚ùå

**STOP! Do NOT deploy!**

**Analyze the failure:**
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Identify which test failed
3. Check the specific assertion that failed
4. Review the relevant contract code

**Common Issues:**

**Issue 1: General offer test fails**
```
Error: InsufficientVoucherBalance
```
- **Problem:** Bug fix not working correctly
- **Action:** Review `_getVoucherHolder()` logic
- **DO NOT DEPLOY!**

**Issue 2: Compilation errors**
```
Error: Compiler error
```
- **Problem:** Contract code issue
- **Action:** Fix syntax/logic errors
- **DO NOT DEPLOY!**

**Issue 3: Timeout errors**
```
Error: Timeout
```
- **Problem:** Test taking too long
- **Action:** Increase timeout in hardhat.config.js
- **Re-run tests**

---

## PHASE 6: Manual Test Verification

**Even after tests pass, verify the critical test manually:**

**Test: General Offer Acceptance**

```javascript
// In Hardhat console (npx hardhat console)

// Get contracts
const vouchers = await ethers.getContractAt("MockERC1155Vouchers", VOUCHERS_ADDRESS);
const offers = await ethers.getContractAt("KektvVouchersOffersV3", OFFERS_ADDRESS);

// Setup: Mint voucher to user
await vouchers.mint(user.address, 3, 1, "0x");

// Setup: Approve offers contract
await vouchers.connect(user).setApprovalForAll(offers.address, true);

// Test: Make general offer
await offers.connect(offerer).makeOffer(
  3, // tokenId
  1, // amount
  ethers.ZeroAddress, // voucherOwner (GENERAL OFFER!)
  { value: ethers.parseEther("1.0") }
);

// Test: Accept general offer (THE CRITICAL TEST!)
await offers.connect(user).acceptOffer(0);

// Verify: Should succeed! ‚úÖ
// V2 would fail here with InsufficientVoucherBalance ‚ùå
```

**If this manual test succeeds:** ‚úÖ Bug fix is verified working!

## Testing Checklist

**Before marking tests complete:**

- [ ] Node.js 22 installed and active
- [ ] Hardhat dependencies installed
- [ ] Contracts compile successfully
- [ ] All 11 tests pass
- [ ] Zero failing tests
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** General offer test passes
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Backward compatibility tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification performed (optional but recommended)

**If ALL boxes checked:** ‚úÖ **SAFE TO PROCEED TO DEPLOYMENT**

**If ANY box unchecked:** ‚ùå **DO NOT DEPLOY YET**

---

## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

**Why Testing is Non-Negotiable:**

1. **Bug Verification:** We MUST verify the bug fix works in tests before mainnet
2. **Security Validation:** Tests catch security issues before real money is at risk
3. **Regression Prevention:** Ensure V3 didn't break V2 functionality
4. **Confidence Building:** Tests prove the contract works as intended

**What Tests Verify:**

‚úÖ General offers can be accepted (THE BUG FIX!)
‚úÖ Targeted offers still work (backward compatibility)
‚úÖ Security features function correctly
‚úÖ Edge cases are handled properly
‚úÖ State management is correct
‚úÖ No unexpected behaviors

**Risk of Deploying Without Tests:**

‚ùå Bug fix might not work
‚ùå Security vulnerabilities might exist
‚ùå Edge cases might fail
‚ùå Real money could be lost
‚ùå Contract might need emergency pause
‚ùå Reputation damage

## Next Steps After Testing

**If tests PASS:**
1. ‚úÖ Document test results
2. ‚úÖ Sign off on testing checklist
3. ‚úÖ Proceed to `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. ‚úÖ Deploy with confidence

**If tests FAIL:**
1. ‚ùå DO NOT deploy
2. ‚ùå Analyze failure cause
3. ‚ùå Fix the issue
4. ‚ùå Re-run tests until all pass
5. ‚ùå Only then proceed to deployment

---

## Emergency Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Cannot install Node 22**
- **Alternative:** Use Remix IDE deployment without local tests
- **Risk:** Higher (no automated test verification)
- **Mitigation:** Extensive manual testing on mainnet after deployment
- **Recommendation:** Only if absolutely necessary

**Scenario 2: Tests timeout or hang**
- **Solution:** Increase timeout in hardhat.config.js to 120000 (2 min)
- **Solution:** Run tests with `--bail` flag to stop on first failure
- **Solution:** Run individual test files

**Scenario 3: OpenZeppelin import errors**
- **Solution:** Ensure `@openzeppelin/contracts` is installed
- **Solution:** Check version matches contract imports (v4.9+)
- **Solution:** Clear cache: `npx hardhat clean`

---

## Conclusion

**Testing is MANDATORY before mainnet deployment!**

**Do NOT skip this phase!**

**The tests verify:**
- ‚úÖ Your bug fix works
- ‚úÖ Contract is secure
- ‚úÖ No regressions introduced
- ‚úÖ Edge cases handled

**Only deploy after ALL tests pass!** üß™‚úÖ
